  * [Inspecting the Page](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/dom/)
  
* *In class assignment:*
Using an online code editor of your choosing (such as Glitch, Codepen, CodeSandbox), create an index.html file and add the follwing:
  * A DOCTYPE tag
  * An html tag
  * A head
    * Include a title and meta tag for the viewport
  * A body
  * In the body, add a large heading that acts as a headline that declares your favorite restaurant
  * Below this large heading, add a smaller sub-heading that tells the user a bold statement about this restaurant
  * Include *sensational* paragraph text that tells a fictional 3-4 sentence story about this restaurant.
  * Add a ridiculous image of a food item that this restaurant sells. Note, you will either need to find an image on the internet and link to its url or upload it to the project.
  * Somewhere on the page, include a link to an external website. Make sure that link opens in a new tab or window. Bonus: Embed that link in the image.

*Download* a code editor of your choice (if unsure use visual studio code)

*Assignment*: Using [this as an example](https://codepen.io/callihiggins/pen/jOEjrPQ), add a Nav bar to your page that makes sense with the context of your restuarant's page. At the moment, it will just look like a bulleted list- that's ok! We'll make it look like a nav bar next week with css. Turn in the link to your codepen in the discord. Due by next class.

Learning Log: If you haven't done a learning log for week 1, investigate something that comes up while doing this assignment and dig a little deeper. Publish a 1 paragraph learning log to the discord channel that outlines something you found interesting by Wednesday.
