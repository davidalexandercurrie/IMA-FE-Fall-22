## A note about this syllabus
This is a living document, as are the materials in this course repository. There are certain aspects of our course, such as our calendar or grading criteria, that will not differ from this syllabus unless there are extenuating circumstances. However, the pacing of this course may vary depending on student need, comprehension and technologies that are sometimes rapidly changing in the midst of our learning process. I will do everything in my power to update you on any changes ASAP (in class and via Discord) and to stay fully transparent about what you are expected to learn, produce, and share. Please engage in open communication, as I will do the same.

## Course Pre-requisites

Basic computer knowledge. Basic familiarity with any programming/scripting language is preferred but not required.

## Course Description

This course will provide a foundation for understanding modern web development with a focus on front end technologies and accessing public data. The forms and uses of these technologies are explored in a laboratory context of experimentation and discussion. This studio stresses interactivity, usability, and the quality and appropriateness of look and feel.

Students will create two web applications, including one that leverages public APIs and Javascript libraries. The goal of the course is for students to learn how to think holistically about an application, both by designing a clear user experience and understanding the algorithmic steps required to build it. Assignments are arranged in sequence to enable the production of a website of high quality in design and engineering.

### Program Learning Objectives

**Students will:**

1 – Effectively utilize computer programming to complete creative projects that may include working with data and engineering front end web experiences

2 – Learn how to think algorithmically; understand the process of breaking a task into discrete steps that a computer and/or user may employ to complete it.

3 – Students will develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.

4 – Students will gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

5 – Students will develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1 - Design, build, and develop content for a professional-quality website.

2 - Understand and implement the iterative process

3 - Learn how to proactively learn, also known as self-regulated learning. In any learning situation, you should study beforehand, make/do, debug, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again (iteration). Learning happens in a cycle.

4 - Create an internal developer / creative community

### Course Structure

Class time will be spent as a combination of lecture, review, and in class exercises. Homework will consist of online tutorials as well as weekly projects that build on each week’s topics of discussion.

#### Readings

There is no required textbook for this course, however students will be required to complete various online tutorials between classes.

#### Laptop Usage During Class

I love having WiFi available and I think it is a valuable tool for use in the classroom. Unfortunately, it can very easily be a distraction as well. Laptop use will be expected in class but should be focused on class-specific material, applications, and research. Whenever classmates or guests are presenting please keep your laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on your attention and active participation, so please respect your fellow classmates and close your lid. Recreational use of phones, music players, video game systems and other devices are forbidden. 

## Grading

NOTE: While you are expected to document and host your work on Github or another external server, links to assignments, projects, and documentation will be submitted and graded on Brightspace. This will allow me a space to privately communicate any notes and point deductions connected to each student's assignment. It will also allow you to track your progress in the class. After midterm and final presentations, grades from the Brightspace gradebook will be migrated to Albert.

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

**Regular Assignments 30%**

We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. Most assignments will include a Learning Log, where you will be asked to provide some assessment of your clarity on a topic after doing a tutorial. Please refer to the Learning Logs file in this repository for more instructions.

Each assignment is due by the next class meeting after they are assigned unless stated otherwise. 
It is expected that you will spend 6 to 8 hours a week on the class outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading, watching video, completing assignments and so on. Please budget your time accordingly.

Each assignment will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete (half credit), or incomplete (no credit). To be complete an assignment should meet the criteria specified in the syllabus including documentation.  If significant portions are simply not attempted or the assignment is turned in late (up to 1 week) then it may be marked partially complete. If it is more than a week late, not turned in, or an attempt isn’t made to meet the criteria specified it will be marked incomplete.

**Mid-Term Project 20%**

The midterm assignment will be a project that demonstrates a working knowledge of website design and responsive HTML & CSS. This project must be completed, published, and presented.

**Participation and Attendance 20%**

Attendance is *mandatory*. Please inform me via Slack direct message if you are going to miss a class. Showing up late for class or an excessive number of absences will adversely affect your grade. This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. This (along with attendance) is 20% of your overall grade. Each student will be asked to do a 5-min presentation on a Learning Log throughout the semester, which is part of your participation grade.

At most two (2) unexcused absences will be tolerated without effect to your grade. Any more than two (2) unexcused absences will result in a lowering of your final grade by one whole grade for each unexcused absence. For example, three (3) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a B instead of an A.  Four (4) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a C and so on. Six (6) unexcused absences will result in an automatic F for the course.  Two (2) late arrivals will count for one (1) absence.

**Final Project 20%**

Class will culminate with final projects. It is expected that these will be both technology and content driven. The final project will be built over the course of several weeks. This project must be completed, published, and presented.

**Documentation/Tickets to Leave 10%**

5% - Students will be expected to document their work on Github. This will involve regular publishing of source code and assignments, using comments and README files as necessary. (Github will be a topic we cover in class.)

5% - At the end of each session, students will need to submit a Ticket to Leave. Please view the Ticket to Leave file in this repo for specific instructions.

## Qualitative Grading Overview

Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, and improvement that their work shows.

#### A. Excellent (90-100)

Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the web design and development process.

#### B. Very Good / Good (80-89)

Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average web design and development process.

#### C. Satisfactory (70-79)

Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of the web design and development process.

#### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69)

Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of visual foundation. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

#### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)

Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest.
